Our postcards come with unique content for every recipient, an Interactive voice and SMS response system, and lead augmentation with additional data from other sources. We combine this with a budgeted cost share that takes no time for you to maintain. There is no more back and forth between agent and Lender on what to send and how to split. All RESPA compliant with the reports.

                                    The speed of delivery depends on the services you purchase. We submit your postcard for printing the minute you paid for your order. We offer two services, Standard can take up to 14 days and First Class will take about 5 days. Delivery times are approximate and depend on the USPS.   
                                </p>

                                    The phone number on the postcard is an Interactive Voice and SMS response IVR number. This was done so you never lose a lead. If they text, our system responds or if they call they have an option to connect to you directly.    
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We understand that you are not always available to pick up the phone every time they call. However, this is an expectation of the consumers now. If there is a call from a new phone number, we will send you a new lead notice as well as add other available information like address, name, and possibly even FB profile. All this information will not be added if they call you directly. It is like having an automated secretary to answer for you.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When we send your lead your other URL, they would need to provide an email address to get more details.
